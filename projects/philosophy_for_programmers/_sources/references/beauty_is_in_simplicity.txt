Beauty Is in Simplicity
=================================

There is one quote that I think is particularly good for all software developers to know and keep close to their hearts:

Beauty of style and harmony and grace and good rhythm depends on simplicity. — Plato
In one sentence I think this sums up the values that we as software developers should aspire to.

There are a number of things we strive for in our code:

- Readability
- Maintainability
- Speed of development
- The elusive quality of beauty

Plato is telling us that the enabling factor for all of these qualities is simplicity.

What is beautiful code? This is potentially a very subjective question. Perception of beauty depends heavily on individual background, just as much of our perception of anything depends on our background. People educated in the arts have a different perception of (or at least approach to) beauty than people educated in the sciences. Arts majors tend to approach beauty in software by comparing software to works of art, while science majors tend to talk about symmetry and the golden ratio, trying to reduce things to formulae. In my experience, simplicity is the foundation of most of the arguments from both sides.

Think about source code that you have studied. If you haven't spent time studying other people's code, stop reading this right now and find some open source code to study. Seriously! I mean it! Go search the web for some code in your language of choice, written by some well-known, acknowledged expert.

You're back? Good. Where were we? Ah yes... I have found that code that resonates with me and that I consider beautiful has a number of properties in common. Chief among these is simplicity. I find that no matter how complex the total application or system is, the individual parts have to be kept simple. Simple objects with a single responsibility containing similarly simple, focused methods with descriptive names. Some people think the idea of having short methods of five to ten lines of code is extreme, and some languages make it very hard to do this, but I think that such brevity is a desirable goal nonetheless.

The bottom line is that beautiful code is simple code. Each individual part is kept simple with simple responsibilities and simple relationships with the other parts of the system. This is the way we can keep our systems maintainable over time, with clean, simple, testable code, keeping the speed of development high throughout the lifetime of the system.

Beauty is born of and found in simplicity.

Beauty Is in Simplicity  譯文
-----------------------------------

個人認為，有句名言是所有軟體開發者都必須知道且放在心上的：

`風格、和諧、優雅與節奏之美皆源於簡潔。- 柏拉圖`

簡而言之，我認為這句話涵蓋了身為軟體開發者所嚮往的價值(美德)。

在撰寫程式時，我們努力追求下列目標：

- 可讀性
- 維護性
- 開發速度
- 難以捉摸的美

柏拉圖想傳遞的訊息是，所有上述提到的目標，都源自於簡潔。

何謂美的程式碼？這其實是一個非常主觀的問題。依據每個人的成長背景，對於美的認知都有所不同。讀藝術的人與讀科學的人對美的認知就有差異。讀藝術出身的人對於電腦軟體是否美的評斷主要是在該軟體相關的 artwork，而讀科學出身的人則傾向以對稱性、黃金比例等來評斷軟體之美。憑個人經驗而論，無論上述哪種評論角度，簡潔是所有評論的依據。

想想你曾研究過的程式碼。假如你尚未花時間研究過別人的程式碼，請停止閱讀這篇文章並立刻找別人的程式碼來閱讀。我是認真的！到網路上去找一些由知名的開發者撰寫的程式碼（C, Python等都可以，只要你喜歡）來閱讀。

讀完了嗎？很好！我們上次講到哪？噢，我發現啊，那些能讓我產生共鳴且是我認為「美」的程式碼都有一些共同的特性。這些特性中最重要的就是簡潔。我發現到，無論整個系統或 application 有多麼複雜，每個單一的部分或模組都努力維持簡潔。簡單的物件負責簡單的任務，物件內包含簡單、對任務聚焦的 methods，且具有良好命名方式。

美的程式碼說穿了其實就是簡潔的程式碼。每個獨立的部分都賦予簡單的任務，系統內不同部分之溝通也盡力簡潔。以簡潔及可測試的程式碼所組成的系統，在其生命週期中就能一直俱有高維護性及維持高速的開發。

**「美」出於簡潔，「美」發現於簡潔。**
